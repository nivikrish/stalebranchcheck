# stalebranchcheck
The Python script (repoCleaner_no_auth.py) does the following:

Reads Repositories: 
The script reads a list of repositories from the masterRepoList.txt file.

Fetches Branches: 
It retrieves the list of branches for each repository using GitHubâ€™s REST API.

Identifies Stale Branches: 
It checks the latest commit date of each branch and compares it to the current date to determine if the branch is stale (older than 1 year).

Prompts for Deletion: 
For stale branches, the script asks the user if they want to delete the branch.

Deletes Selected Branches: 
After the user confirms, the script deletes the stale branches.

Generates a Summary: 
The script outputs an executive summary of deleted branches and recommends deleting the repository if all branches are stale.

Following will be the output:
